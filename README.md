# AutoSync
This tool is designed to automatically synchronize files from a source folder to a destination folder, such as a Google Drive directory. After selecting the source and destination folders, the script runs in an infinite loop, checking for new files in the source folder every hour (this time is adjustable) and copying them only if they do not already exist in the destination. This ensures efficient and automatic backup or synchronization without copying files. This is especially useful for regular data archiving or synchronization of work with the cloud.
